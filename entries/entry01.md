### Freedom Project decision

At this point in the project stage it would be good to lock ing what tool we will be using for the freedom project.
 We have already done 
 
 * Tool research
 * Week 1 of Tinkering
 * Week 2 of Tinkering
 
 Since those have been completed It is most necessary to lock in the tool and objective of this web app. The tool me and my partner Tarek will be using is [Google App Script](https://script.google.com/home/start) to make an Organization App. The use of this app will benefit those who are not the most organized when it comes to work due dates or events or document arrangements.
 
 The next steps for this project would be to begin the base learning of the tool so we can take its features and use it to our advantage when it comes time to code the program. The engineering design process is taking place as we have now changed from the use of [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to [Google App Script](https://script.google.com/home/start). 
 Skills to take away from this are...
 
  * Always have some kind of backup plan
  * When confirming something always consider "Will this 100% work?"
