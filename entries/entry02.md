### Learning the tool

Well it's that time where we actually leanr the tool we locked in. By immediatie observation google script is like an extention to your google sheets, docs, slides, etc...

The script activation is done manually as of my current knowledge as I am not sure of the google app script full limitations just yet but on google script it can set headings and decorate to a certain extent. Previewing your code is not really easy at all and is difficult to preview as you go.

### Goals

It's always good to have some kind of goal at certain points throughout a project to keep you on target for completion by the due date. That being said my goal for winter break is to finally see some code in action on our project. Whether it is actually going to help code the organization app it will still end up being a step forward.

### Process

As it seems we have been learning through video tutorials as they are more engaging than just reading article after article. The learning process not only needs to be effective but also engaging to keep us going. [The very first tutorial we watched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd3DV_heK2Q)

This part in the project is the very simple learning stage. Next steps following this is still to learn for awhile until a decent amount of gs concepts are understood. Atleast enough until we are ready to build the project. Every step in this project is carefully approached about as taking a large step will create too much confusion perhaps more than necessary.

Some skills that can can be taken away from this part in the project is that you should never take on a project build before you have learned the actual content. Another skill being you should always follow a goal completion process to never fall behind. These goals should be small and achievable and not far feched.
